As noted on these cards, you can cache exactly 1 food token when their power is activated by placing it on a bird card. Once a food token is cached on a bird card, you cannot spend it. Each token on the card at the end of the game is worth 1 point. If the same dice are showing in the birdfeeder, you may reroll to see if you meet the condition of the bird. If you run out of food tokens, you can cache cards instead.",
